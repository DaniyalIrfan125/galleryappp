## Code Structure
This app is developed following MVVM architecture pattern.

Applications follows on activity code structure with sharedviewmodel to share data between fragments

Application is having 3 fragments
(MainFragment, GalleryDetailsListFragment, ShowImageFragment)




## Fragment Functionalities
1- MainFragment is created which first checks the runtime permissions on button click. After checking runtime permissions if the permissions are allowed then it calls the method fetchImagesAndVideos which is using flows zip operator to call 2 methods (queryImages and queryVideos) asynchronously and after collecting all the data through collect function of flows then separateFolderFiles method is called which separates all the data according to the respective folder names.
Once all this business logics are done inside view model then the data is being ovberved and shown it in the view using observer pattern.

2- GallerDetailsListFragment is to show the data lists respective to the folder being clicked for example if all images folder is clicked then this fragment will show all the images in list.

3- ShowImageFragment is created to show the imageview on full screen and it has pinch to zoom feature as well same like gallery app.
